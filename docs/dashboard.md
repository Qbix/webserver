## 📊 Live Dashboard

Open `http://localhost/Q/dashboard` in your browser for a real-time server dashboard. Updates live via WebSocket — no polling, no page refreshes.

**What it shows:**

| Panel | Metrics |
|---|---|
| **Overview cards** | Total requests, current RPS (5-sec window), avg response time, slowest request, memory usage + peak, worker status, WebSocket connections, active rooms, data transferred, open connections |
| **Throughput sparkline** | Per-second request rate for the last 60 seconds — see traffic patterns at a glance |
| **Top paths** | Most-requested URLs with hit count and average response time — find your hot paths |
| **Active rooms** | WebSocket room workers with member count — monitor real-time features |
| **Live request log** | Scrolling feed of every request: timestamp, status code (color-coded), method, URI, response time in ms |

**Endpoints:**

| URL | Format | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `/Q/dashboard` | HTML | Browser — the visual dashboard |
| `/Q/health` | JSON | Load balancers, uptime monitors (lightweight) |
| `/Q/stats` | JSON | Monitoring systems — full stats payload |

The `/Q/stats` JSON includes everything the dashboard shows, plus `sparkline` (60 data points), `topPaths`, `activeRooms`, `statusCodes` breakdown, and `cache` stats. Feed it to Grafana, Datadog, or your own monitoring.

## ⚙️ Control Panel

Password-protected admin panel at `/Q/panel`. First visit sets the password.

**Apps tab** — discovers sibling app directories (any folder with `web/` or `config/app.json`). Create new apps, serve them (hot-switches the document root), open in VS Code, run configure scripts. Editable apps directory path.

**Scripts tab** — list and run PHP scripts from `scripts/Q/` (configure, install, translate, etc.)

**Plugins tab** — reads the app's `config/app.json` for declared plugins, `local/plugins.json` for installed versions, and scans the Platform's `plugins/` directory. Shows version, dependencies, and DB connections for each.

**Playground tab** — PHP REPL with all Q classes preloaded. Write code, hit Run (or Ctrl+Enter), see output. Sandboxed in a forked process with disabled filesystem writes, no network, 32MB memory limit, 5 second timeout.

**System tab** — PHP version, OS, extensions, memory limit. One-click Platform install: clones `github.com/Qbix/Platform`, runs `git submodule update --recursive`, sets up `local/paths.json`.

The panel is restricted to localhost by default. Set `Q.panel.remote: true` in config to allow remote access.
